## Getting started

CSS stands for **C**ascading **S**tyle **S**heets and is the styling layer of a website or application.

### Selectors

When targeting elements in CSS you have multiple options for how to target them using selectors.

```css
h1 {} /* targets h1 elements */

.title {} /* targets any elements for a class of title */

#headline {} /* target the element with id of headline */
```
