### Variables

These are used to store and keep track of information

ECMAScript is the standard and JavaScript is the implementation. JavaScript has become the dominant in web development in the frontend with progress in the support of newer EMCAScript versions being supported in browsers and the use of frameworks like Vue, React and Angular. On the backend Node.js is used in a majority of cases.

`parseInt()`- converts strings to integers
`parseFloat()`- converts to decimal numbers

`Math.random()` - generates a random number between 0 & 1
`Math.floor()` - rounds number down
`Math.ceil()` - rounds number up

<!-- Look up math object -->

### Functions

The key part of JavaScript - a set of instructions to be used over and over again.

**function expression** is a function assigned to a variable e.g.

```javascript
var myFunction = function(){
    alert('This is a test')
}

myFunction() // then you need to call or invoke function
```

Function can be anonymous as above or they can be passed parameters e.g.

```javascript
myFunction2(para1, para2){
  // do something
}
```
