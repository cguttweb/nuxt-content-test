## Getting started

HTML stands for **H**yper**T**ext **M**arkup **L**anguage it is the structure of web pages. You can create a very basic HTML5 structure using the [emmet plugin](https://www.emmet.io/) `html:5` or simply `!` which gives this:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Document</title>
</head>
<body>
    <!-- Your content added here -->
</body>
</html>
```

To learn more about emmet check out this great [cheat sheet](https://docs.emmet.io/cheat-sheet/)

When HTML5 was released it introduced a number of semantic elements including `<header>, <footer>, <article>, <aside>` and others.


```html
  <main>
    <section>
        <header>My section heading</header>
        <p>This is a great article about HTML.</p>
        <footer>Copyright 2020 by The Author<footer>
    </section>
  </main>
```
