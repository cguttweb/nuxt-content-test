## Getting started

Vue as noted in the [documentation](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/) is a progressive framework for building User Interfaces. I found the best place to started was with the documentation which is very good and I am still learning and with Vue 3 ~~due out soon~~ out now.

## Vue CLI

The [vue cli](https://cli.vuejs.org/guide/) is a tool for rapid vue prototyping as it will setup a folder structure for you. It can be installed using the following command:

```javascript
npm install @vue/cli -g
```
